\section{Introduction}

Differential equations are just equations involving the derivatives of functions. There are partial
differential equations - differential equations involving partial derivatives of functions, and
ordinary differential equations - differential equations which just involve ordinary derivatives. 

We can also classify differential equations by the order of the derivatives they involve:
\begin{defn}[Order]The \emph{order} of a differential equation is just the order of the highest
  order derivative that it involves.\end{defn}
